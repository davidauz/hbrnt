//Using PersistenceManager (JDO):
//Used if JDO is preferred or mandated.
//JDO provides features such as transparent persistence, support for object graphs, and a flexible query language.
//It might be suitable for complex object-oriented models.
//JDO has a smaller ecosystem compared to JPA: fewer third-party libraries and community resources available.
//It's also less commonly used in the Java ecosystem compared to JPA and Hibernate.
